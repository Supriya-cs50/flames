ðŸ”¥ FLAMES Game in Python: 
A fun little project that implements the classic FLAMES game in Python. Just input two names, and find out what kind of "relationship" they supposedly shareâ€”Friendship, Love, Affection, Marriage, Enemy, or Siblings!

ðŸ§  How It Works: 
The game takes two names, removes common characters, and counts the remaining letters. Based on the total count, it cycles through the letters in "FLAMES" to determine the final relationship result.

ðŸ“š Why I Made This: 
Just for fun and practice. A nostalgic game many played as kids, now coded in Python for a bit of learning (and I wanted to see if Python could predict my love life).
